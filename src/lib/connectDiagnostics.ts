/// Splice Connect is the one part of the client that cannot be debugged by
/// looking at it: the symptom lives in the relationship between two machines,
/// and the person who hits it is not going to have a debugger attached to
/// both. So it records measurements to the same diagnostics file as everything
/// else, and the numbers are the point — drift and clock skew are only useful
/// if they can be read back as numbers rather than parsed out of a sentence.
///
/// What it deliberately does NOT do is trace. Group sync runs at 1 Hz *per
/// peer*, so an hour with three of them is around eleven thousand ticks; a line
/// each would blow through the log's 2 MB rotation in one session and take the
/// cross-launch timeline — the reason the log exists — with it. Instead the
/// per-tick numbers are folded into a bucket and one summary line is written
/// every 30 seconds. Individual lines are reserved for decisions (a correction
/// fired) and for lifecycle, both of which are rare enough to read.
///
/// The authentication fingerprint never appears here. It is a replayable
/// bearer secret on the LAN and the v1 wire contract says to keep it out of
/// logs and diagnostics. Neither do track id lists: a handoff carries up to a
/// thousand of them and the count is the only part worth having.
