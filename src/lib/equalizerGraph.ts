// How the equalizer gets into desktop playback.
//
// The iOS client has to hand-write biquads because AVPlayer only exposes raw
// PCM through an MTAudioProcessingTap. The web platform hands the same filters
// over as BiquadFilterNode, so this file is much smaller than its Swift
// counterpart, and the maths that both clients agree on lives in equalizer.ts.
//
// Three constraints shape everything here:
//
// 1. `createMediaElementSource` is one-way. Once an element is routed into an
//    AudioContext its audio only reaches the speakers through that graph, and
//    there is no API to put it back. So attaching is done lazily, the first
//    time the listener actually turns the equalizer on, and turning it off
//    afterwards flattens the filters rather than trying to undo the routing.
// 2. The element must be CORS-clean or the graph outputs silence. Splice's
//    audio comes from its own local media proxy, which already answers with
//    `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on both the streamed and the downloaded
//    path, so `crossOrigin = "anonymous"` is safe. It has to be set before any
//    `src` is assigned, which is why createElement in usePlayback sets it
//    rather than this file setting it at attach time.
// 3. An AudioContext can start suspended under an autoplay policy. Every
//    attach and every apply nudges it, because a suspended context is silence
//    that looks exactly like a bug.
